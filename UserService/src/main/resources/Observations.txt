Some observations/learnings while building this application/service:

1. Including spring boot starter security endpoint automatically provides a /login endpoint, and also a default UI for
    authentication.

2. Spring boot JPA dependency compulsorily needs a DB URL defined, else it will throw error during build stage
3. Add dda-auto update to true for DB updates
4. Need to add hibernate dialect as MySQLDialect for establishing mysql connection with hibernate
5. "ddl-auto: update" needs to be added for entity to be created/updated in mysql
6. "Build project automatically" option is checked in "Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler",
    "Allow auto-make to start even if developed application is currently running." in "Compiler -> Advanced Settings" so
    that dev tools are used after adding plugin
